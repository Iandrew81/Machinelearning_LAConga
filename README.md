# Advanced topics in data science. LA-CoNGA

This repository contains lectures and workshops on various machine learning topics. The topics covered in this repository include:

## Supervised Learning

    Naive Gaussian Bayes
    Classification
    Regression
    Cross-validation


## Unsupervised Learning

    K-means Clustering

## Ensemble Methods

    Decision Tree
    Random Forest
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)


## Deep Learning

    Gradient Descent Method
    Deep Neural Network
    Backpropagation
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Model Evaluation

    Cross-Validation
    Confusion Matrix
    Precision and Recall
    F1 Score

Each topic includes notes, programming exercises, and sample code. These materials were originally created in Google Colab as part of the Advanced Topics in Data Science course at LAConga 2022. They have been migrated to this GitHub repository for ease of access.

## Workshops
In the "Talleres" folder, you'll find three workshops that were carried out as part of the final project of the course that cover most of the material presented in the notes.
